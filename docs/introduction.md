# Introduction

**Otto-m8** (automate) is a low code platform that provides a flowchart like UI to build and 
deploy traditional deep learning and AI workloads as a REST API.


## Use Cases
1. Building AI Agents, with Tool Calling support.
2. Fast prototyping different LLM's as they come out.
3. Building REST API to host your LLM's and ML models, and not worry about FastAPI at all.

## Project Roadmap
- [x]  Basic Chatbot and HF workflows
- [x]  Function Calling
- [x]  Lambda Functions/ Custom Code blocks
- [x]  Multimodality for Huggingface
- [ ]  Multimodality for OpenAI
- [ ]  SDK for interacting with deployed workflows
- [ ]  Observability for every block's output like a Logger or Tracer
- [ ]  Memory for Chatbot and RAG. Goal is to not clutter the drawing board.
- [ ]  Streamline workflow creation, edits and redeployment. Some form of version control ML Model Training via UI?
- [ ]  **Got ideas for other integrations you think will be useful? Create a Github [Issue](https://github.com/farhan0167/otto-m8/issues)**
